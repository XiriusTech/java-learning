# AutoFilter Example

This is a sample project for the [AutoFilter](https://github.com/XiriusTech/auto-filter) library. For detailed documentation, please refer to that project.

This sample consists of a Spring Boot application that uses the main features of the library:
-@AutoFilter annotation
-@AutoFilterInclude annotation
-@AutoFilterExclude annotation
-Custom MultiFilter
-Custom SingleFilter with its corresponding QueryBuilder
-Use a filter generated with @AutoFilter as parameter of another @AutoFilter

## Execution

You can execute the application by compiling the project and running the ```AutoFilterApplication``` class. This will start a server running on localhost:8080 by default (you can configure the port if you want).
You can then try the interactive documentation in the **Tutorial** tab of the Swagger UI page, which you can access in a browser by going to http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui. 
You can also send queries directly (e.g. using Postman). This is a sample query: ```GET localhost:8080/api/v1/user?username.startLike=adm```
Finally, the demo uses the H2 database, which is an in-memory database. It is populated by executing the statements in **resources/data.sql**. You can modify that file if you want to test different data.
